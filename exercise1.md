CI Setup in Python Development

CI Tools
	•	Linting: Tools like Pylint and Flake8 are used to enforce code quality and style.
	•	Testing: pytest is popular for unit and integration tests, with unittest as a built-in alternative.
	•	Building: setuptools and Poetry are commonly used for packaging and managing dependencies.

CI Alternatives

Besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions, alternatives include:
	•	CircleCI, GitLab CI, and Travis CI for easy integration with GitHub and Bitbucket.
	•	Tools like Bamboo, TeamCity, Buddy, and Drone.io offer additional options depending on team needs.

Self-Hosted vs. Cloud-Based CI
    A cloud-based CI setup is ideal for this due to its scalability, lower cost, and ease of use. It allows automatic scaling as the project grows, reduces maintenance by handling updates and security patches, and requires no investment in physical infrastructure. Cloud solutions also integrate easily with popular source code repositories, streamlining setup. For teams without the resources to manage servers, cloud-based CI offers a more efficient and reliable option.

Decision Factors
	•	Budget: Cloud solutions have lower initial costs but can be pricier over time.
	•	Security: Self-hosted CI offers more control over data and access.
	•	Scalability: Cloud-based CI tools are better for fluctuating workloads, while self-hosted suits steady projects.
	•	Technical Expertise: Cloud options are easier to manage, while self-hosted requires more technical resources.
